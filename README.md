# Position-To-Text
## FIVEM Plugin

Allows user to easily save 'x , y , z , h' coordinates using the command /pos in chat.

This script is a modified version of 3DME by https://github.com/Sheamle/3dme , using heading context from Albins coordinates which display via TextDraw https://github.com/Albin-Eriksson/abn_coords
Both scripts were publically released , if anyone has any problems please contact me.
